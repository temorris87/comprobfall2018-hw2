Implement the integration of the propagation process with Gazebo. Define the
start state at the bottom left of the maze environment and a ``goal region''
at the top right. Use your RRT implementation with Gazebo in order to
discover solution trajectories. Demonstrate these trajectories in Gazebo
as described above.

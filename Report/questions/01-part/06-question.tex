\question{[10]}

Solve the corresponding path planning problem for these 50 queries with the
various versions of the PRM algorithm. Generate graphs where the x axis
corresponds to computation time and the y axis corresponds to path quality.
Report the resulting path quality (and the first time that a solution is found)
for the various versions of the PRM algorithm and as the size of the roadmap
increases.
